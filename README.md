1. For this project, the video game will be titled "Shark Chase", where the player will autimatically be a surfer at sea, and come across a great white shark where they will have to answer certain trivia questions to increase their speed and get to land safely.
2. The Health class will keep track of the player's health as they move along in the game. Wrong answers will decrease the players' speed and leading them to get injured by the shark. If the next answer is correct, the player's speed will go back to normal and if it's wrong the game is over.
3. There will be an increase_speed function which increases the player's swimming speed when they answer the question correctly.
4. There will be a while loop which continues running as long as the player has health.
5. A list will also be used to store the player's progression in the game.
